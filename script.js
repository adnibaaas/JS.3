/* Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. 
In his country, it's usual
to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. 


It's not
allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and
then try to convert it to a ternary operator!) 


2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). 


Example: 'The
bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25' 


TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430 


HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2 HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >=
50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰ 


GOOD LUCK ï¿½ */

let tip = bill <= 300 && bill >= 50 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2
